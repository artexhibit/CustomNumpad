# CustomNumpad

My implementation for a Numpad Keyboard with numbers and simple calculation operations to use in a pet project.

I use it in my pet project instead of a build-in numberPad keyboard to give user a better look and extra functionality (math calculations).

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-   **UIKit**;
-   **Storyboard and Xib** for UI
-   **UIBezierPath** and **CAShapeLayer** for drawing
